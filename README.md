# Management-system-for-a-candy-company
The project involves developing a dynamic memory-based program for managing a gummy candy company's employee and project system, was written in C.
The program presents a menu with 8 options, allowing users to add employees, create projects, join existing projects, view projects and employee participation, add or remove project features, handle employee departures (including updating or deleting relevant projects), and exit the program while ensuring proper memory deallocation.
The data structure consists of arrays of pointers for employees and projects, with pre-defined structs for Employee, Project, and Attribute.
The program is case-sensitive, allows unlimited menu interactions (except for exit).
